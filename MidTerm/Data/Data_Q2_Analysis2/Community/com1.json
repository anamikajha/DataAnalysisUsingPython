Almost always, something turns up that makes the knot far more intense. <br/><br/>Then I make a plan for dealing with that particular issue. Once I've worked out a plan, i find I go back to sleep. If I don't follow up on my plan, a few days later, the anxiety wakes me up again, as a reminder to get with the plan. <br/><br/>While I still do occasionally wake up during the night, there are no more knots in my stomach. That makes it a little more difficult to identify the problem, but the method still works. <br/><br/>So that works for anxiety. As for ants; I've concluded I need to get used to living with lots of life forms I'd rather not have to share my home with. Here in Taiwan, we keep pretty much everything edible in sealed containers. The natives have mostly made peace with that and I, as an American Expat, try to do the same. <br/><br/>One thing I done is to set up a honey feeding station for ants in a place away from food.
