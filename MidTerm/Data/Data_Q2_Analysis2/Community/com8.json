At the end of your posting, you raise the question about whether or not the Wall Street Gang is doing it's job, paying attention.  I think that unfortunately, they are doing their job, which entails most of all making huge sums of money for their rich and elite clients. In the process they make obscene amounts of money for themselves. They don't care about the small fry kind of people such as yourself and my mother, who lives a lot on the investments she and my dad made to live on in their retirement (golden years). My dad died from cancer in June 2014, and I worry about my mom and her supporting herself at 85 yrs of age. This of course is of no concern for the greedy, money grubbiing, bottom feeders that make up this self centered financial world nowadays.
