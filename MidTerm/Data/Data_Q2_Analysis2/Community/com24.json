Not every injustice and failure to get what you want, to be liked, acknowledged or recognized is due to skin color or poverty.

Will a quota calm your heart, ease your pain? If seeking love and recognition is the game, hatred and anger are ultimately an ill conceived strategy whether you are black, brown, cream, ochre, yellow, alabaster or white, with or without privilege.

They want what they want for members of the tribes they favor, and that's it. <br/><br/>In my line of work, academia, in the absence of such a law, we routinely bend over backwards to hire female and minority graduate students with little or no teaching or publishing experience over highly accomplished white male PhD's for the few tenure track jobs that even exist any more. If the ads simply said, e.g., \"no white males need apply, we already have people who look like you,\" at least it would be honest. We would no longer be treating people as we would never consent to be treated ourselves - being unemployed, seeing a job we'd love to have, getting our hopes up, putting great time and effort into applying for it, not knowing the whole time that we have no chance of getting it because of the race and/or gender into which we were born. <br/><br/>If Ms. Gay is going to insinuate that social justice demands proportional representation by race and ethnicity across the board, I look forward to her advocacy of such a law.
