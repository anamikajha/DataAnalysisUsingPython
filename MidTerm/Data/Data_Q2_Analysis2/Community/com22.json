We remain irrationally reticent about developing innovative means for organizing economic activity and so we remain subject to unpredictable fluctuations.  <br/><br/>We clearly need to develop a balance between free enterprise and rational economic management.  We still believe that management is necessarily stifling and oppressive.  The solution to this is plain.  If management of the economy is made entirely transparent and truly democratic then it will be responsive to the full range of considerations.  It will be the antithesis of stifling and oppressive.  It will in fact bring a substantial measure of economic justice to our system while at the same time ensuring economic activity that is both robust and rational.  <br/><br/>This approach can be termed Participatory Economic Management, parallel to Participatory Democracy (a a growing political innovation).  It's time to give serious thought to the design of such systems.  Technology will certainly play a key role, making it possible for large number of people to participate in the gathering and processing of economic and political data and in deliberation and decision making.  <br/><br/>Our current system, as contentious and stumbling as it is, has been remarkably effective in some ways.  The next system will inevitably be a dramatic improvement, just as capitalism and socialism were dramatic improvements in their times.
