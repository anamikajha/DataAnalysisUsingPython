On inequality.  Darwin: \"If the misery of the poor be caused not by the laws of nature, but by our institutions, great is our sin.\"<br/><br/>Yes, our institutions.  Adam Smith: \"The difference of natural talents in different men is, in reality, much less than we are aware of... The difference between the most dissimilar characters, between a philosopher and a common street porter, for example, seems to arise not so much from nature as from habit, custom, and education. When they came into the world, and for the first six or eight years of their existence, they were, perhaps, very much alike, and neither their parents nor playfellows could perceive any remarkable difference. About that age, or soon after, they come to be employed in very different occupations. The difference of talents comes then to be taken notice of, and widens by degrees, till at last the vanity of the philosopher is willing to acknowledge scarce any resemblance.\"<br/><br/>Human diversity is inevitable.  Social inequality, a hierarchical social order is not, and increasingly it is morally intolerable.  Just like different skin color cannot justify the enslavement of ones by others or sexual differences cannot justify patriarchy and gender exploitation, differences in physical propensities or modes of learning, often reinforced by historical inequities that pass from generation to generation, are unacceptable as alibis for a vertical social order.
