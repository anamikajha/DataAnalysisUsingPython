It was our last lunch before he retires officially. Before lunch, however, I went to our common barber, Sam, located in the Civic Opera Building. Sam was actually introduced to me by my friend George back when I worked across the street. It was purely coincidental that Charles and I wound up with the same barber. Sam works with two or three other barbers, depending on their business. Apparently they just hired a new barber. Some young man in a suit came in and asked about getting a haircut. Sam greeted him and immediately sat him in the empty chair next to mine. A few minutes later the new barber returned with some coffee and immediately went over to the stranger. They started a conversation and I couldn't help overhearing some of it. The customer introduced himself. His name was DYLAN. He spelled it out.
