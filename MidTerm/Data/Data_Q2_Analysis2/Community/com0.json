Then the person in the presiding officer's chair says something and a bunch of other people grumble and it is declared that one-fifth of those present want the Yeas and NAYs; or in other words, an [oral vote]. Then the presiding officer says that the clerk shall call the roll and those in favor are to answer by saying \"Yea\" while those opposed answer by saying \"No\". \"NAY\" is a term for a negative [oral vote]; it doesn't have to be the thing that the voter says to indicate opposition.
