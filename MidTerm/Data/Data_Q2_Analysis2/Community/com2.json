Sometimes, the email accounts are \"hacked\" and the emails are released to the public.<br/><br/>This is a crime and should not be countenanced.<br/><br/>Anyway, some time back, a NYT Op-Ed columnist was preparing a thorough piece about gender discrimination in \"Hollywood\". She had an email exchange with the then-head of SPE, whose husband used to be a NYT reporter; both husband and wife are friends with the columnist. (For details, see the Public Editor's Journal entry for Dec. 12, 2014.)<br/><br/>In concluding their exchange, the head of the movie studio emailed the columnist, \"I HOPE YOUR HAPPY!!!\" along with affectionate personal remarks. The columnist wrote back, repeating the affectionate personal remarks, but writing, \"I hope you're happy\".<br/><br/>That exchange illustrates that NYT writers not only know how to spell contractions, but also that they resist using all caps when they write emails about gender discrimination.", "replies": [], "assetURL": "http://wordplay.blogs.nytimes.com/2016/01/01/mass-master/", "statusID": 2}, {"rgt": 11, "userDisplayName": "Boren", "commentTitle": "<br/>", "editorsSelection": 0, "commentID": 17096745, "userID": 1203302, "commentType": "comment", "replyCount": 1, "recommendationCount": 0, "updateDate": "1451714106", "assetID": 3444537, "commentSequence": 17096745, "lft": 8, "userLocation": "<br/>", "parentID": null, "status": "approved", "userTitle": "NULL", "approveDate": "1451714106", "userURL": 1203302, "createDate": "1451714053", "commentBody": "I just tried this and it was a disaster.
