I'm not sure how that aim is diminished if Sander's healthcare proposal isn't ready to be adopted on the first day of his presidency. If incrementalism is the right way forward, why isn't Hillary Clinton laying out incremental steps toward single-payer healthcare or some comparable arrangement?<br/><br/>That said, I think a candidate like Sanders is rightly criticizable if, as is charged, his policy really does rely on magic asterisks and is deflects attention from its actual implications. But even if that is all true, he's facing opponents who are more than wiling to do the same thing. It's one thing to say that politicians shouldn't fudge numbers in proposals to voters. It's another thing to say that my favored candidate shouldn't fudge numbers in their proposals, given that all of the other candidates fudge on their major proposals and never seem to suffer significant setbacks in their candidacy for doing so. Perhaps Americans should be persuaded that not all ineffective treatments should be part of the health system.

We have taken in almost a million refugees since 9/11, I don't recall any banks being broken. Can you point to any fiscal hardships?

Not too much.  Much of this work is outsourced to groups like Catholic Charities and furniture, etc. is largely donated. The government resttlement period is six months and most charities do not help more than three or four months. I helped some families get settled through Catholic Charities, and the refugees I met were eager to jump in to American society, start working and start building their lives.  Many of them have family support or support among their ethnic group.  And the government gives each refugee less than a grand to get settled.<br/><br/>The bottom line: refugees are forced to flee.
