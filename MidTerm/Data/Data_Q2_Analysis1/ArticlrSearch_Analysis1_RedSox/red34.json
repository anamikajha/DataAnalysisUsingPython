Up to 1955, the western frontier of the major leagues was St. Louis. Then it moved a few hundred miles to Kansas City, and in 1958 rugged pioneers named Walter O'Malley and Horace Stoneham followed John C. Fremont across the Rockies to California to present baseball to the natives in exchange for colored beads.
