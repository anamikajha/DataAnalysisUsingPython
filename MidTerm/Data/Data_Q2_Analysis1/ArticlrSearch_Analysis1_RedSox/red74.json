''When we made the movie, it was always, wink, wink, 'What if the year we make the movie is the year they win the World Series?''' said Elizabeth Gabler, the chief executive of Fox 2000, which is making the film for 20th Century Fox.

They also shot a coda to the film, which has Mr. Fallon and his love interest, Drew Barrymore, above right, running onto the field at the real-life moment of the Red Sox historic triumph over St. Louis.
