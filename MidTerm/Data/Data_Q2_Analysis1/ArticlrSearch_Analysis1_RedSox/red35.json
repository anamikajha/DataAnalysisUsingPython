Rebuffing the chap's commiserations that the Yankees were trailing by eight and a half games, he sneered that no Yankee fan - a species about as common as the whooping crane, but not as valuable - is ever much concerned about the Red Sox until after Labor Day. And then not at all. We do not see very many of Zion's stripe in New England (although, to be sure, one is more than enough); usually we catch them at Customs and turn them back around. About the only evidence of Yankee devotion we see around Boston are the dark blue caps with ''NY'' on the front, perched on the heads of inebriates and desperately idiosyncratic types sartorially, relieving the boredom of collecting litter from highway median strips (which, come to think of it, is probably where they found the caps).
