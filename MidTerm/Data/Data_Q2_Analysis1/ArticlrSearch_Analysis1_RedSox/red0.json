Enos Slaughter never hesitated in sprinting from first to home for the decisive run. 1967 -- Jim Lonborg pitched a one-hitter and a three-hitter for Boston, but Bob Gibson had three complete-game victories for the Cardinals, including the Game 7 matchup with Lonborg. 1975 -- There seemed to be no stopping Boston after Carlton Fisk's dramatic home run in the 12th inning won Game 6 and evened the Series with Cincinnati.
